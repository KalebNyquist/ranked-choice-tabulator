### Monotonicity Check

In this election, Bob Kiss was elected the winner in the fifth round. However, there exists a range of non-monotonicity where Andy Montroll will paradoxically win the election if Bob Kiss receives additional votes in the form of higher rankings.ยน

Before we start moving votes around, note that Andy Montroll only needs 429 votes to beat Bob Kiss, and if Kurt Wright is eliminated before Andy Montroll that will give Andy Montroll an additional 1016 votes over Bob Kiss. Only 740 votes separate Kurt Wright from Andy Montroll, and every additional vote for Bob Kiss over Kurt Wright decreases this gap.

Non-monotonicity begins when, of the 3295 voters who prefer Kurt Wright over Bob Kiss & Andy Montroll, at minimum:

- 495 of the 495 voters who **prefer Bob Kiss over Andy Montroll** defect, and place Bob Kiss above Kurt Wright 
- 245 of the 1289 voters who **equally rank Bob Kiss and Andy Montroll** defect and place Bob Kiss above Kurt Wright and Andy Montroll
- 0 of the 1511 voters who **prefer Andy Montroll over Bob Kiss** defect and place Bob Kiss above Kurt Wright and Andy Montroll

In this range of non-monotonicity Andy Montroll will win the election instead of Bob Kiss despite not receiving any more votes due to Kurt Wright having an earlier elimination.

Non-monotonicity ends when, of the 3295 voters who prefer Kurt Wright over Bob Kiss & Andy Montroll, at maximum:
- 495 of the 495 voters who **prefer Bob Kiss over Andy Montroll** defect, and place Bob Kiss above Kurt Wright 
- 587 of the 1289 voters who **equally rank Bob Kiss and Andy Montroll** defect and place Bob Kiss above Kurt Wright and Andy Montroll
- 0 of the 1511 voters who **prefer Andy Montroll over Bob Kiss** defect and place Bob Kiss above Kurt Wright and Andy Montroll

At this point, Bob Kiss will still be elected winner when receiving more votes.

ยน: For simplicity, non-competitive minor candidates have been factored out.
